[2025-11-04 19:03:21] USER: How many products are in each category?
[2025-11-04 19:03:23] THOUGHT: I need to count products per category. I should first inspect the 'products' table to understand its structure and how categories are represented.
ACTION: describe table{"table_name":"products"}

[2025-11-04 19:03:29] THOUGHT: I have the schemas for `products` and `categories`. I need to join `products` with `categories` on `category_id` and `id` respectively, then group by category name and count the products in each group.
ACTION: query database{"query":"SELECT c.name AS category_name, COUNT(p.id) AS product_count FROM products p JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id GROUP BY c.name ORDER BY product_count DESC"}
